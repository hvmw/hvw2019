The website for HVW'19, the third installment of the Helmut Veith Memorial
Workshop, is online. The workshop will take place at the Schlosshotel Seewirt,
situated right in the middle of the Turracher HÃ¶he skiing area. As last year,
the workshop will consist of three days, where each day starts with a half-day
of talks, and leaves time for social activities (like skiing) in the afternoon.

The following is a summary of the most important points about the workshop:

* **Arrival**: March 17, 2019, in the evening
* **Dates**: March 18, 2019 - March 20, 2019
* **Included**: three nights accommodation at Schlosshotel Seewirt
